This is just my neovim config, that's it

If you want to use this you're gonna need the [vim-plug package manager](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
(the plugins folder is not in the repo to avoid taking up a lot of space, so you need to run `:PlugInstall`)

You also need to install the various lsp programs (e.g pyright) for autocomplete

I personally use neovim-git from the aur, but this should work with older versions too (probably 0.7+)
